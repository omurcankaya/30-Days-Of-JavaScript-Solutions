# Welcome!
>*First of all why did I want to create a repository like that?\
Actually im newbie on JavaScript, i want to build a career about Web and Mobile Technologies. It seems to me i need to learn JavaScript to learn both Mobile and Web Technologies.
So, i want to see own development proccess and maybe i can help you about how to solve  [30 Days Of JavaScript](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript/)'s excercises. As i mentioned before im newbie on JavaScript so probably my solutions are not best solutions and I may not have solved every problem if you can't find the solution i didnt solve it :)*

**X -> Means Exercise Level.**\
**Y -> Means Question Number.**\
**Exercise 3 Question 2 -> 3.2***
